controller: from hout file copy the data to the lan file even if sent by same lan, so there could be
other receivers in the same lan as source

then router checks in each lan file if there is a message to be sent forward to other lans,
mark some routes as pruned and dont copy the message there, also on NMR routes

if some node is sending inf as its next distance to you, then its a next hop.. if all nodes are sending non inf then send NMR
Remove all lans? where there are no recievers
Also if a router recives NMR from all its links, then send NMR to its router towards source
