The code is written on Java and have used open JDK 17. The code has been tested on net01.utdallas.edu which has jdk 1.8.

Please compile the code using below command

javac Host.java Router.java Controller.java ReadWithLocks.java WriteWithLocks.java

Once done the object can be invoked as ex:

java Host 0 0 sender 50 20

Do not use the run.cmd or cleanup.cmd, they are to test on Windows machines only.

I have attached the updated test files shared by Dr. Cobb to use java pretag. Please compile the code before invoking.
